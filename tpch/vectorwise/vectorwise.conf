# Configuration file for Vector databases
#
# The location of this file determines the scope of its influence.
# These are the available locations (from least to most important):
# - vectorwise.conf in global data directory -- affects all databases in
#			the installation
# - vectorwise.<dbname>.conf in global data directory -- affects only the
#			named database
# - individual database directory -- affects only that database
#
# This file is divided into sections for various parts of the system. 
# Currently available sections are:
# [server]
# [system]
# [cbm]
# [memory]
# [engine]

# The standard method of defining an option is:
#[section]
#option = value
#
# NOTE: For all numeric attributes, you can use K/M/G notation, 
#   which stands for multiples of 1 kilobyte, 1 megabyte, 1 gigabyte.
#   Notation KB/MB/GB is also accepted.
#
# NOTE: All options are case insensitive (except for file names).
#
# NOTE: When referencing options in this file, we use 
#   the "section/option" notation.
# 
# NOTE: The server must be restarted to put into effect any changes
#   in this file.

[memory]

# ============================================================================
# Memory options
# This section configures the memory used by the processing layer
#
# NOTE: See cbm/bufferpool_size option for configuring buffer pool size.
# ============================================================================

max_memory_size=100000.0M
# Specifies the amount (in bytes) of the total memory available for 
# query execution.
# NOTE: Some queries will fail if they consume too much memory; 
#   increasing available memory can help.
# NOTE: If max_memory_size is not specified or is not larger than zero, 
#   the default setting of 50% of the system memory is used.
# NOTE: Memory size defined with this option does not include 
#   memory used by cbm/bufferpool_size.
# DEFAULT: 0 (use 50% of the system memory)

#min_mem_per_transaction=10M
# Specifies the minimal memory reserved for each running transaction.
# DEFAULT: 10M

#use_huge_tlb=FALSE
# Try and use huge pages, if available in the system. Correct operating
# system configuration is needed, please refer to the documentation for
# operating system specific instructions and issues.

max_overalloc=0
# Specifies the maximum amount of memory that will be overallocated
# (reserved as virtual memory) for zero-cost growing of certain memory
# areas. A value of 0 means no overallocation; A value of -1 means 
# overallocate with the amount of total system memory ("unlimited"). 
# Needs only to be changed in rare cases.
# Note that overallocation should be disabled on operating systems where:
#   /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory is not 1, or
#   "ulimit -v" is not unlimited 
# DEFAULT: 2G

[system]

# ============================================================================
# System options
# This section defines various aspects of the system
# ============================================================================

num_cores=40
# Specifies the number of cores in the system. 
# This value is used to calculate the amount of memory available for 
# each transaction.
# DEFAULT: 1

max_transactions=69
# Specifies the maximum number of active transactions in the system. 
# New incoming transaction requests after reaching this limit are queued.
# CAUTION: The value of max_transactions should always be higher than the
# value of connect_limit in the Ingres config.dat by at least one. It is
# recommended to set this value 5 or more higher than the value of
# connect_limit. Although this restriction is not enforced, not adhering
# to it could result in blocked connections.
# Generally, this value should only be changed if the value of connect_limit
# is increased.
# DEFAULT: 69

#vectorsize=1024
# Specifies the number of records processed together. 
# DEFAULT: 1024

#use_sse42=yes
# Uses SSE4.2 for accelerated string processing on CPU architectures 
# that support it.
# DEFAULT: YES

[cbm]

# ============================================================================
# CBM (Column Buffer Manager) options
# This section configures the management of I/O and buffers
# ============================================================================

bufferpool_size=40241.1M
# Specifies the buffer pool size in bytes (that is, disk cache). 
# NOTE: If bufferpool_size is not specified or is not larger than zero, 
#   the default setting of 25% of the system memory is used.
# NOTE: Memory size defined with this option does not include 
#   memory used by memory/max_memory_size
# NOTE: Can be changed without reloading data, but requires a server restart.
# DEFAULT: 0 (use 25% of the system memory)

block_size=2MB
# Specifies the minimum I/O granularity. 
# WARNING: This setting cannot be changed after database creation! 
# DEFAULT: 512KB

#group_size=8
# Specifies the number of blocks to handle in every disk request.
# WARNING: This setting cannot be changed after database creation! 
# DEFAULT: 8

#io_prefetch_blocks=16
# Specifies the number of blocks to prefetch on each read.
# DEFAULT: 16

#queue_depth=32
# Specifies the length of the asynchronous I/O queue.
# DEFAULT: 32

#minmax_maxsize=1024
# Specifies the granularity of the (automatically created) 
# min-max indexes on all columns. Min-max indexes are used automatically 
# to derive scan ranges based on selection predicates on columns that 
# correlate to tuple order. A higher value for this parameter means that 
# these ranges become more precise (that is, the default setting 
# wastes only 0.1% of a full table scan). This parameter should be set before 
# database creation.
# DEFAULT: 1024

compression_lz4_enabled=false
# Enable or disable LZ4 compression for strings. LZ4 compression reduces
# data size and I/O workload but might increase processing time. Useful
# when a large part of the database consists of string data.

[engine]

# ============================================================================
# Processing engine options
# This section configures the processing layer
# ============================================================================

max_parallelism_level=40
# Defines the level of auto-parallelism. A value larger than 1 enables 
# multi-core parallelism.
# DEFAULT: 1
